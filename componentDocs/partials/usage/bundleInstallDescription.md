In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `[namespace]-[name]__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

We recommend you load these bundles using [differential serving](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) so that the browser only loads the bundle correctly. To accomplish this, the script tag for the modern bundle should have `type="module"` and the script tag.
