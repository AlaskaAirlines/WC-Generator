In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `[namespace]-[name]__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

**WARNING!** When installing into your application environment, DO NOT use `@latest` for the requested version. Risks include unknown MAJOR version releases and instant adoption of any new features and possible bugs without developer knowledge. The `@latest` wildcard should NEVER be used for production customer-facing applications. You have been warned.
