Once a pull request has been created, the assigned reviewer will receive a notification.

Pull request response time depends on the scope of the pull request.

* If the work is solicited and there is an issue assigned to the work, the author of the pull request should expect to receive feedback within 24 hours.
* If the work is unsolicited, and/or is a new feature or refactor of a current feature, the author may expect to wait up to 72 hours for feedback as this will take additional resources to understand the scope of the update.

The reviewer has the option to leave comments, ask questions and reject the pull request if warranted.

Once a reviewer has approved the work, the pull request can then be merged into the main branch.
