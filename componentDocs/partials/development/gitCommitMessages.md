Once you have completed your feature update, please commit all changes to the branch. All commit messages should use an **imperative mood**.

Imperative mood simply means _“spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”_. A few examples are:

* Clean your room
* Close the door
* Take out the trash

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

_"If applied, this commit will (your subject line here)."_

For example:

* If applied, this commit will `refactor component X for accessibility`
* If applied, this commit will `add feature Y to component X`

Example messages when using Conventional Commits:

```
$ build(postCss): update the build step to include postCSS #67

$ docs(install): address typo in install instructions #14

$ perf(api): restructure API to comply with new feature spec #12

$ feat(data api): add ability to consume large data as an array versus string #71

$ fix(color api): address color output issue #105
```
