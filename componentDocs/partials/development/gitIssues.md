A bug is defined by: _"A demonstrable problem that is caused by a file in the repository."_ Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

To submit an issue, please go to [Auro's project status board](https://auro.alaskaair.com/component-status) and click on the ISSUES badge associated to project you wish to submit an issue for.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported. Go to Auro's [project board](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1) and click on labels like `type: bug` or `type: feature` to filter through the many issues between all of Auro's projects.
  * For bugs - [https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22)
  * For features - [https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+feature%22](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+feature%22)
1. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest main or feature branch in the repository
1. Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to follow up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Poor bug reports will be closed as the team is unable to reproduce the issue.

For more information about the issue submission process, please see the [Issues: work status label maintenance](https://auro.alaskaair.com/contributing/issues-prs-labels) section of the Auro contributing guidelines
