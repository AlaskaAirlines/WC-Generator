No one other than repository managers have direct access to any repository. For non-team members, pull requests must originate from a [forked repo](https://auro.alaskaair.com/contributing/upstream) in your own Github account.

All new work that is to be considered for merging with the `main` branch must start from a new feature branch of work. This feature branch should be in response to either a [reported bug](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22) or a [new business requirement](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22type%3A+feature%22).

Unsolicited pull requests **will take longer** to respond to. We ask for your patience. To help expedite any pull request, we ask that you **submit an issue first**. This will help the team understand the problem you are trying to solve before submitting the solution.

For more information about the pull request submission process, please see the [Pull Requests](https://auro.alaskaair.com/contributing/issues-prs-labels) section of the Auro contributing guidelines
