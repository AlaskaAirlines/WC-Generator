Be sure to check out our [getting started](https://auro.alaskaair.com/aurolabs/minors) page for helpful tips when starting a new project.

For help with the WC-Generator API and to see what version you have installed, run `$ wc-generate --help`.

With each new repo created, the version of the generator will be added to the bottom of the `./README.md` file. As versions of the WC-Generator progress this will help authors to understand where the feature gap is.

<small>Built from WC-Generator v[genVersion]</small>
```

To migrate a repo from one version of the generator to another, please reference [Auro migrate shell script](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/generator/upgrade).
