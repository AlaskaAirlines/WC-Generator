## Upgrade your repo with the latest generator

Time marches on and the generator marches forward. We are always looking for ways to make our custom elements and our developer experience better. And because of that, it's easy to get behind. The Auro team makes this easy to keep up with. First, you can always tell what version of the generator your project was built from as a version is listed at the bottom of the `./README.md` file.

```html
<small>Built from WC-Generator v2.10.8</small>
```

To upgrade your project to the latest generator build, simply follow the steps as outlined in the Generator section of the Auro site, specifically, [Auro migrate shell script](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/generator/upgrade).

> Install this BASH shell script to easily migrate an existing Auro custom element to a new repository based on a current build. This process does not upgrade an existing repository but migrates the necessary files from a legacy repo to a newly created repo.
