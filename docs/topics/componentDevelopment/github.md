Auro's WC-Generator comes with an opinionated `settings.yml` for the repository. These settings are regularly reviewed and approved by the Auro team. It is asked that you do not change these settings. These settings pre-config the repository itself, setting up `main` as a protected branch, and updates all the issue labels.

For more information on the use of labels, please be sure to take a look at [Issues, pull requests, and labels](https://auro.alaskaair.com/contributing/issues-prs-labels) in the Auro doc site.

Each new repository is pre-configured to seamlessly publish your new custom element with npm and host all your code with Github.
