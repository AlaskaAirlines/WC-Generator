Auro takes accessibility very seriously. For one, our testing tools come pre-configured with a first-pass test.

```js
it('[namespace]-[name] is accessible', async () => {
  const el = await fixture(html`
    <[namespace]-[name] cssclass="testClass"></[namespace]-[name]>
  `);

  await expect(el).to.be.accessible();
});
```

From there we only go up! Each Auro element comes pre-configured to use Auro's design tokens. Atomic elements of the UI are vetted regularly for accessibility issues.
