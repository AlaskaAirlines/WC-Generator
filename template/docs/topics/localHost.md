You will need to open two different shell sessions. One is for the **npm tasks**, the second is to run the **server**.

```shell
// shell terminal one
$ npm run dev

// shell terminal two
$ npm run serve
```

Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

_Note that your `serve` instance may define a different port to use if 8000 is already in use._
