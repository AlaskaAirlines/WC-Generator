Automated tests are required for every Auro component.

Run `$ npm test` to execute the tests and check code coverage. Tests must pass and meet a certain coverage threshold to commit.

Tests are located at `.\test\`.

See the [testing documentation](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/tests) for more details.
