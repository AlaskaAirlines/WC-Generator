Once the project has been cloned to your local resource and you have installed all the dependencies you will need to open a shell session to run the **dev server**.

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

If running separate sessions is preferred, please run the following commands in individual terminal shells.

```shell
$ npm run build:watch

$ npm run serve
```
