In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. Two bundles are available -- `[namespace]-[name]__bundled.js` for modern browsers and `[namespace]-[name]__bundled.es5.js` for legacy browsers (including IE11).

Since the legacy bundle includes many polyfills that are not needed by modern browsers, we recommend you load these bundles using [differential serving](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) so that the browser only loads the bundle it needs. To accomplish this, the script tag for the modern bundle should have `type="module"` and the script tag for the legacy bundle should have the `nomodule` attribute. See the example below.
