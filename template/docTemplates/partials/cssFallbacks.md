[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.
